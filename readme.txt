- 500 epochs, experimented with the LR (4e-4 seems solid), exhausted model capacity... at 4 layers
- 0.1877 accuracy **revisited: I'm not confident that model capacity was necessarily exhausted


1/14/26 
 - 597 epochs, switched file type mid way through, 8 layers - not yet exhausted... 
 - train loss: 2.77, val loss: 2.73, accuracy: 0.1894
